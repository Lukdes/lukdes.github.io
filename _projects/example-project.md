> ### A few things first
>
> Every project NEEDS to have _at least_ this at the start
>
> ```md
> ---
> layout: post
> title: "Your Project Name"
> image: "/assets/img/logo.png"
> image-alt: "alt text description"
> ---
> ```
>
> it would be nice to include your role, company, and categories when applicable as well
> AND SUPER nice if you had a link to the live project OR github repo (if you add it, the title will link to it and become a hyperlink, if not it remains as a title)
>
> ```md
> ---
> layout: post
> title: "Your Project Name"
> role: "Your Role in this Project"
> company: "Company or Class, when applicable"
> categories: a "word" or a ["list", "of", "words"] 
> ---
> ```
>
> word of caution: any category you add will become part of the generated url
> e.g. categories: ["hi", "this", "is", "too", "much"] --> website.com/hi/this/is/too/much/post.html
> SO, I recommend you sticking to one category per post AND at most 3 category options
